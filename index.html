OK... enough of that third person stuff. It’s freaky.

Well, freaky to me.

I get why you’re here: “this guy does stuff,
but is it any good?”

Great question. But, uh, I won’t answer that.

... ?

what? “is my dude here being serious? his portfolio site
is talking to me in my own voice? did he just use ‘my dude’ unironically?”

Yeah. That’s what’s happening. But it’s cool, yo.

You see... I want you to enjoy this brief moment.
We don’t have a lot of time here on Earth, so we’ve
got to make it count. And I think you count. I really do.

That’s kinda my philosophy to life. You count, and I care.
I care a lot; I give a shit. And my philosophy to life bleeds
into my philosophy to design. I’ll give you my all and then some,
my 110%, whether you’re my boss, my teammate, my customer...
the next person in-line at the store, the person making me a
beautiful cup of coffee, the person blowing through a corner
stop sign in the local neighborhood during a fit of road rage...
or my mom (love you mom.)

Some folks call it human-centered design.

It’s what I do.

So take a look around, but don’t stay too long. You’ve got better
things to do. And if you think I can help you do those things,
send me a note. We’ll do it together.

Because you deserve beauty. We all do.

love & peace,
Paul
